# Eigong Prime

A mod that makes Eigong harder by increasesing the amount of moves she can choose when stringing to another move.

Both Eigong's speed and base health values can be changed using BepInEx Configuration Manager, but the mod works fine without it. 

For players who like Eigong's moveset :P

# How to install

Download the latest STABLE BepInEx (https://github.com/BepInEx/BepInEx/releases) and extract it into your game's root folder (the one with NineSols.exe on it). 

Then start up the game for it to generate the necessary files and folders. After that you wanna close the game again and go to BepInEx/plugins. That's where you'll put mod dlls, so you extract both NineSolsAPI and EigongPrime, take their dlls and move to that folder.
